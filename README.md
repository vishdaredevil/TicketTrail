# 🎫 Ticket Trail - Redbus Frontend Clone

**Ticket Trail** is a modern, high-fidelity frontend clone of a major online bus/train ticket booking platform (Redbus). The project is built entirely using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript** with the **Bootstrap 5** framework to showcase advanced UI/UX development, interactivity, and design replication without any backend dependencies.

## ✨ Features

This project focuses on simulating dynamic user experiences that are typically handled by a server:

  * **Reliable Multi-Language Interface:** Fully functional language switcher for **English, हिन्दी (Hindi), and தமிழ் (Tamil)**. Key text elements (headers, tabs, buttons) update instantly when a language is selected.
  * **Dynamic Search Simulation:** Interactive search bar with simulated type-ahead city **recommendations** and cross-input **swap functionality**.
  * **Modern Deals Section:** Replaced the static card with an **innovative live deal timer** and a functional **copy-to-clipboard** button to simulate urgency and exclusive offers.
  * **Trending Offers Toggle:** **"View All/View Less"** button dynamically expands the offers carousel into a full grid view on desktop for a seamless browsing experience.
  * **Animated Key Metrics:** A sleek, automatically rotating **Metrics Carousel** showcasing company achievements with a smooth transition (replaces the old static SEO content).
  * **Utility Modal:** Functional **"Help"** query submission form modal using Bootstrap for user support simulation.
